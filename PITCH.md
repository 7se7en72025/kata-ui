# Vercel OSS Application â€” Kata UI

## Project Pitch

### Why should your project be accepted?

**Kata UI fills a gap in the React component ecosystem: motion-driven, accessible components that feel alive.**

Most component libraries focus on how things look. Kata UI focuses on how things **feel**. Every component is built around physics-based animations, intention-driven interactions, and weight â€” the sense that UI elements have mass and momentum.

### The Problem

React developers building modern landing pages and marketing sites face a painful tradeoff:

1. **Use a component library** (shadcn/ui, Radix) â€” excellent for forms and data, but static and lifeless
2. **Build custom animations** â€” requires deep expertise in Framer Motion, GSAP, or WebGL
3. **Use template sites** â€” locked into someone else's design, not customizable

**There's no middle ground.** Kata UI is that middle ground â€” copy-paste components with built-in motion that work out of the box.

---

### Who Uses It

- **Solo developers** building landing pages who want polish without animation expertise
- **Design engineers** prototyping interactive experiences at startups
- **Marketing teams** shipping high-conversion landing pages fast
- **Open source projects** needing accessible, production-ready motion components
- **Bootcamp graduates** who want to ship impressive sites without deep CSS knowledge

### What Makes It Different

| Feature               | Kata UI | shadcn/ui | Framer Templates |
| --------------------- | ------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| Motion built-in       | Yes     | No        | Yes              |
| Accessible (axe-core) | Yes     | Partial   | No               |
| Copy-paste ready      | Yes     | Yes       | No               |
| shadcn registry       | Yes     | N/A       | No               |
| Free forever (MIT)    | Yes     | Yes       | No               |
| WebGL shaders         | Yes     | No        | No               |
| E2E tested            | Yes     | No        | No               |

**Key differentiator:** Kata UI is the only React component library that combines **motion-first design**, **accessibility testing**, and **shadcn registry compatibility** in a single package.

### Technical Quality

- **45 unit tests** with Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Accessibility testing** with axe-core on every PR (WCAG compliance)
- **E2E tests** across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
- **TypeScript strict mode** â€” zero `any` types
- **Tree-shakable** â€” import only what you need
- **CI/CD** â€” GitHub Actions with test matrix (Ubuntu/Windows x Node 18/20), CodeQL security scanning, Lighthouse performance audits
- **Docker** â€” Multi-arch build with Trivy vulnerability scanning
- **Nightly builds** â€” Scheduled dependency health checks

---

### Growth Potential

The React ecosystem is moving toward motion. React 19, Next.js 14+, and the rise of AI-powered UI generation all favor dynamic, animated interfaces. Kata UI is positioned to be the go-to library for this shift.

**Current trajectory:**

- 20+ installable components via shadcn registry
- Live documentation site on Vercel with preview deployments
- Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline ensuring quality
- Production-ready components with TypeScript support
- Community-ready with CONTRIBUTING.md, Code of Conduct, and issue templates

**Growth roadmap:**

- More motion components (parallax, scroll animations, page transitions)
- Framer Motion integration layer
- AI-assisted component generation
- Figma design kit
- Community component submissions

### How Vercel Credits Help

The $3,600 in platform credits would be used for:

1. **Hosting** â€” Keep the documentation site fast and reliable as traffic grows
2. **Preview deployments** â€” Every PR gets a live preview for faster iteration and community review
3. **Analytics** â€” Track which components are most used to prioritize development
4. **Speed Insights** â€” Ensure the site stays performant as the component library grows

---

### The Bigger Picture

Kata UI contributes to the open source ecosystem by making motion accessible. Instead of every developer reinventing animation patterns, they can install a component and get physics-based interactions for free.

This is exactly what shadcn/ui did for forms. **Kata UI does it for motion.**
